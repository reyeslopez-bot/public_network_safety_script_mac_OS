# macOS Setup Script for Bash and WireGuard

This repository contains a script that automates the setup of a newer version of Bash and the WireGuard VPN on macOS systems. It ensures that the environment is consistent and secure for development or personal use.

## Features

- Installs the latest version of Bash using Homebrew.
- Configures and starts WireGuard with minimal manual intervention.
- Automates the entire setup with a single script execution.

## Prerequisites

- macOS (Tested on macOS Catalina, Big Sur, and Monterey)
- Homebrew (The script will install Homebrew if it's not already installed)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [Repository-URL]
   cd [Repository-Directory]

To run the script:
sudo bash setup.sh

Configuration
Before running the script, ensure to modify the WireGuard configuration placeholders in the wg0.conf template within the script:

Replace <your-private-key> and <peer-public-key> with your actual WireGuard keys.
Adjust the Endpoint to the URL or IP address of your WireGuard server.
Additional Information
Make sure to log out and log back in after the installation to ensure all changes take effect, especially the update to the Bash version.
Check the script comments for detailed explanations of each step.

### requirements.txt
The `requirements.txt` file is typically used for Python projects to list all package dependencies. Since your project primarily uses Homebrew for installation and doesn't depend on Python packages, this file may not be necessary. However, if there are any specific Brew packages needed, you could list them in a similar style for documentation purposes:

```plaintext
bash
wireguard-tools
This file could be used purely for informational purposes unless you adapt a script to use it for installing dependencies directly via Homebrew.

Usage
Save the README.md content: Create a new file named README.md in your project directory and paste the markdown content provided.
Save the requirements.txt content: Create a new file named requirements.txt in the same directory if needed for documentation.
To install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
cat requirements.txt | grep -v '^#' | xargs brew install
